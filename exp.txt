			pyttsx3 Jarvis DAY1


1.	I am using python -v 3.8 and i tried to play with pyttsx3 for the jarvis project , but it showed a TypeError.
2.	I think the pyttsx3 is not for the latest version of python, so i installed python -v 3.6.8 , but i am getting the same error.
3.	So after googling the problem , i now have used the command
	ModuleNotFoundError.
4.	Again after googling i found a solution to this error. it is to "pip install pywin32" and voila its working.
5. 	I am going to try the same thing but with the python -v 3.8.1 interpreter.
6.	And its working. So the issue wasn't the version of python but the version "pyttsx3" and then "win32 client".
7.	To take commands a module named "SpeechRecognition" will be used. But even after installing it am getting an error , that 		PyAudio not found, check installation.	 
8. 	I tried to pip install pyaudio but it didn't work. So now i am pip installing pipwin first then i will pipwin install pyaudio.


			When i tried to make an executable file
9.	While testing the executable file , the first error i faced was "ModuleNotFoundError" for "pyttsx3" and then "win32....". Which i 		solved by adding the command below in my setup file on which the cx_freeze module builds.


	#code for the setup file#
from cx_Freeze import setup , Executable
setup(name = 'JARVIS',
        version ='0.4',
        description = 'Bot',
       *options = {"build_exe":{"packages":["pyttsx3",'win32com.server.util'],"excludes":[""]}},*
        executables = [Executable("F:\projects\jarvis\jarvis.py")])

10.	Now the exe file is working completely fine.
